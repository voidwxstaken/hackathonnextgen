Explanation of the **Screen Time Tracker**

# config.json
The `config.json` file is like a note that tells the computer what kind of project you're using. In this case, it says:

```json
{
  "template": "bolt-vite-react-ts"
}
```

This means the project is using a special setup called **"bolt-vite-react-ts"**, which includes tools to help build a website or app using **React** (a way to make websites), **TypeScript** (a kind of code that helps catch mistakes), and **Vite** (a tool that makes loading faster). It's just setting up the tools you’ll use to make your project.

# index.html
This `index.html` file is like the main page of your website — it tells the browser what to show first.

Put simply, here is what the index.html is doing:

* It sets up the **title** at the top of the tab: “AI-Powered Children's Screen Time Tracker”.
* It includes a small icon (the image on the tab).
* It makes sure the website looks good on phones and computers.
* It creates a blank area with `<div id="root"></div>` — that’s where your website content will go.
* It connects to the code file (`main.tsx`) that builds the actual app.

So this file is like the basic skeleton of your website — it gets things ready before showing the real content.
